# View Records Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a new "View Records" feature that allows users to view portfolio data records by selected date period, with the ability to edit individual records when needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created

#### `/src/components/ViewRecordsDialog.tsx`
- Main component for viewing records with date range filtering
- Features:
  - Date range selector (start date and end date)
  - Table view displaying all records in the selected range
  - View-only mode by default
  - Edit icon button on each row to enable editing
  - Responsive design with scrollable content

#### `/src/components/EditRecordInlineDialog.tsx`
- Inline edit dialog that opens when user clicks the edit icon
- Features:
  - Pre-populated form with existing record data
  - Form validation using Zod schema
  - Update functionality with success/error notifications
  - Clean and intuitive UI

### 2. Database Functions Added

Added to `/src/utils/portfolioDatabase.ts`:

- **`getRecordById(recordId: string)`**
  - Fetches a single record by its ID
  - Used for loading record data in the edit dialog

- **`getRecordsByDateRange(portfolioId: string, startDate: string, endDate: string)`**
  - Fetches all records within a specified date range
  - Returns records sorted by date in ascending order
  - Used for populating the view records table

### 3. Integration

Updated `/src/pages/Index.tsx`:
- Added the ViewRecordsDialog component alongside the existing Add Record and Edit Record buttons
- Wired up the `onRecordUpdated` callback to refresh portfolio data after edits

## User Flow

1. **View Records**:
   - User clicks "View Records" button
   - Selects a start date and end date
   - Clicks "Load Records" to fetch and display data
   - Records are shown in a table with date, principle, share value, and benchmark values

2. **Edit a Record**:
   - User clicks the edit icon (pencil) on any row in the view
   - Edit dialog opens with pre-filled data for that specific record
   - User modifies the values as needed
   - Clicks "Update Record" to save changes
   - Table refreshes automatically to show updated data

## Technical Details

- **Type Safety**: All components use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- **Form Validation**: Uses react-hook-form with Zod schema validation
- **Database**: Integrates with existing Supabase portfolio_data table
- **UI Components**: Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- **Notifications**: Uses Sonner for toast notifications
- **Date Handling**: Uses date-fns for date formatting and manipulation

## Benefits

- Non-destructive viewing: Users can browse records without accidentally modifying them
- Selective editing: Edit only the records that need changes
- Date-based filtering: Quickly find records within specific time periods
- Audit trail: All edits update the database directly
- Consistent UX: Follows the same design patterns as other dialogs in the app

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add pagination for large date ranges
- Export records to CSV
- Bulk edit functionality
- Delete record option
- Search/filter within loaded records
- Column sorting
