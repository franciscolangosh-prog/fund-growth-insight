# 30-60-90 Day Rolling Analysis Updates

## Summary
Enhanced the Rolling Metrics Chart component to include market index benchmarking (CSI 300) and automated conclusion remarks for better portfolio analysis insights. Also simplified the Rolling Performance vs Benchmark chart for clearer visualization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Rolling Metrics Chart - Market Index Benchmarking
- **Added CSI 300 Returns Comparison**: When viewing Sharpe Ratio, the chart now displays a second line showing CSI 300 returns for direct comparison
- **Benchmark Calculation**: Implemented `calculateBenchmarkReturns()` function to compute rolling returns for all market indices (SHA, SHE, CSI300) at 30/60/90 day intervals
- **Visual Differentiation**: CSI 300 benchmark line is displayed as a dashed green line to distinguish it from the portfolio performance

### 2. Rolling Metrics Chart - Automated Conclusion Remarks
Added intelligent analysis text below each chart that provides:

#### For Volatility Charts:
- Current volatility level vs historical average
- Risk level assessment (high/moderate/low)
- Volatility range during the period
- Example: *"The portfolio's 30-day rolling volatility has increased to 18.45% (avg: 16.23%), indicating moderate risk levels. The volatility ranged from 12.34% to 22.67% during this period."*

#### For Sharpe Ratio Charts:
- Trend analysis (improved/declined)
- Quality assessment (excellent/good/acceptable/poor)
- Performance comparison vs CSI 300 index
- Average returns comparison
- Example: *"The 30-day rolling Sharpe ratio has improved to 1.234 (avg: 1.045), indicating good risk-adjusted returns. The portfolio is outperforming the CSI 300 index with an average 30-day return of 5.23% vs 4.12%."*

#### For Correlation Charts:
- Correlation trend vs historical average
- Correlation strength assessment (very strong/strong/moderate/weak)
- Market sensitivity interpretation
- Example: *"The 30-day rolling correlation with CSI 300 has increased to 0.756 (avg: 0.682), showing strong correlation with the market index. This suggests the portfolio's high sensitivity to market movements."*

### 3. Rolling Performance vs Benchmark - Simplified Chart

**Problem:** The original chart was too dense with two bars (portfolio and benchmark) at every data point, making it difficult to read and interpret trends.

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### Chart Type Change
- **Changed from BarChart to LineChart**: Provides cleaner, more readable trend visualization
- **Two Lines**: Blue solid line for Portfolio, gray dashed line for CSI 300 benchmark
- **Removed excess return bars**: Focused on showing just the two main lines for clarity

#### Data Sampling
- **Increased sampling rate**: Shows every 20th data point (was every 10th)
- **Reduced visual clutter**: Cleaner x-axis with only month and year labels
- **Better spacing**: Allows users to see trends without overwhelming detail

#### Visual Improvements
- **Simplified title**: Changed from "Rolling Performance vs Benchmark" to "90-Day Rolling Performance"
- **Color-coded excess return**: Main metric shows green/red based on positive/negative performance
- **Larger chart height**: Increased from 200px to 220px for better readability
- **Legend added**: Clear identification of Portfolio vs CSI 300 lines

#### Automated Analysis
Added conclusion remarks that include:
- Overall performance (outperformed/underperformed)
- Average excess return
- Win rate consistency (consistent/moderate/inconsistent)
- Latest excess return value
- Example: *"Over the rolling 90-day periods, the portfolio has outperformed the CSI 300 benchmark by an average of 2.45% consistently (win rate: 65.3%). Latest excess return: +3.12%."*

### 4. Technical Improvements

#### RollingMetricsChart Component
```typescript
interface RollingMetricsChartProps {
  rollingMetrics: RollingMetrics[];
  portfolioData: PortfolioData[]; // Added for benchmark calculations
}
```

**New Functions:**
- `calculateBenchmarkReturns(period)`: Computes rolling returns for market indices
- Enhanced `getChartData()`: Now includes benchmark return data for comparison
- `getConclusion()`: Memoized function that generates dynamic analysis based on selected metric and period

#### PerformanceAttribution Component
**Updated Functions:**
- `calculateRollingPerformance()`: Simplified data structure (portfolio, benchmark, excess)
- Improved date formatting: Shows only month and year for cleaner x-axis
- `getRollingConclusion()`: Generates performance analysis including win rate

**Chart Enhancements:**
- Replaced `BarChart` with `LineChart` from recharts
- Added `Legend` component for line identification
- Conditional color coding for excess return display
- Removed debug console logs for production readiness

### 5. Files Modified
1. **src/components/RollingMetricsChart.tsx**
   - Added portfolioData prop
   - Implemented benchmark calculations
   - Added conclusion generation logic
   - Enhanced chart visualization with benchmark overlay

2. **src/components/PerformanceAttribution.tsx**
   - Changed from BarChart to LineChart
   - Simplified data sampling (every 20th point)
   - Added automated conclusion remarks
   - Improved visual clarity and readability
   - Removed TrendingDown icon import (unused)

3. **src/pages/Index.tsx**
   - Updated RollingMetricsChart component call to pass portfolioData

## Benefits
1. **Better Context**: Users can now compare portfolio performance directly against market indices
2. **Actionable Insights**: Automated conclusions help users understand what the data means
3. **Improved Readability**: Simplified charts are easier to interpret at a glance
4. **Time Savings**: No need to manually interpret charts - key insights are provided automatically
5. **Risk Assessment**: Clear indication of risk levels and performance quality
6. **Trend Analysis**: Identifies whether metrics are improving or declining
7. **Less Visual Clutter**: Cleaner charts focus attention on the most important information
8. **Performance Consistency**: Win rate metrics show reliability of outperformance

## Usage
The enhancements work automatically with existing data. Users can:
1. **Rolling Metrics Chart**:
   - Switch between different metrics (Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, Correlation)
   - Choose different time periods (30D, 60D, 90D)
   - View benchmark comparison (automatic for Sharpe Ratio)
   - Read automated analysis for each configuration

2. **Rolling Performance vs Benchmark**:
   - View simplified line chart comparing portfolio vs CSI 300
   - See color-coded excess return at a glance
   - Read comprehensive analysis including win rate
   - Understand performance consistency

## Testing
